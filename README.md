## Overview and Origin
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
GANs are unsupervised Machine learning algorithms. GANS are used to create data when the training data is limited.

StradVision

StradVision was founded in 2014

The name StradVision was created by combining Stradivarius (the world's most famous string instrument) with computer vision.

StadVision was founded in Seoul in 2014 by Bongjin Jun. The company also has locations in San Jose, Detroit, and Tokyo. 

The idea behind Stadvision is to make a better life for everyone with Vision AI technology.

StradVision is funded through venture capital investments, strategic patnerships and government grants. They have raised over 100 million in funding.

## Business Activities

StradVision is AI based vision processing system for Advance Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). It's purpsose is to detect objects like vehicles, pedestrians, cyclist and even traffic lights. It does this by using the data it captures from multiple cameras. By doing this it provides the user with 360 degree visibility.

StradVision's targets automotive manufactueres and Tier 1 suppliers.

StraVision's ADAS features are available at a fraction of cost compared with it's competitors.

StradVision has a variety of technologies that they use. 

1) Deep Learning: StradVision uses deep learning for tasks like detection objects.
2) Computer Vision: StradVision uses computer vision to analyze images that are capture by the camera sensors. This will help with lane detection, traffic signs, and vehicle dectection.
3) Edge Computing: Stadvision uses edge computing by directly embedding hardware into the vehicles for real time processing without relying on cloud-based services.
4) Sensor Fusion: StradVision uses sensor fusion to get a comprehensive understanding of a vehicle's surroundings. Sensors include, cameras, LiDAR, and radar.
5) Software Development Kits: StradVision uses SDKs to integrate their vision processing software into an exisitng ADAS and autonomous driving systems.

## Landscape

StradVision is in the automotive industry with focus on automotive technology.

A major trend in the automotive technology industry is SDV's. SDV's are software-definded vehicles. In 2032 the global SDV market is expected to reach $211 billion.

Valeo, Continental AG and Tesla are some companies using SDV

## Results

The business impact of StradVision has been to improve safety, enchance efficiency, and market expansion. As the automotice industry shifts toward electric vehicles companies will need more advanced AI solutions.

Core metrics that companies in this field use are:

1) Accuracy and Performance
2) Safety and Reliability
3) Customer Satisfaction
4) Cost Efficiency

StradVision is performing very well based on those metrics.

StradVision is performing at the top and is the leading patent filer when it comes to generative adversarial network (GAN). Other prominent patent filers include Samsung Group and Alphabet.

## Recommendations

I would be interested in seeing what Stradvision could do for the handicap community. They could develope wheelchairs and scooters and embed them with advance software that utilizes computer vision. They could also make it so that someone in a wheelchair/scooter could safely get into a vehicle and be driven around. They could even develope software that would go in both a vehcile and wheelchair/scooter

If they offered this services they would open up an entire new market of customers.

Some additional technology could be a ramp that allows the wheelchair/scooter to get into the vehicle. They could include features that allow the user to control the vehicle using their wheelchair/scooter.

By adding these features StradVision could offer a safe and realable way for someone in a wheelchair/scooter to get in and out of a vehicle and even assist with driving it.
